<p>Have you ever wanted to run your EC algorithm in the cloud? Discouraged by the complexity of EC2? We will deploy your EC algorithm on the cloud for you with our FCUBE framework!</p>

<p>FCUBE supports a Bring Your Own Learner (BYOL) model: it deploys your EC algorithm to hundreds of machines and does all the data management for you. No scripts, no launch hassles, no tedious result collection. FCUBE is (EC) deployment as a service.</p>

<p>For this competition, our goal is to unite the developers of interesting EC classifier algorithms. We seek an experienced informed discussion on the various approaches and techniques without being distracted by one problem at hand. Therefore, we have set up the following format:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone gets the same computational budget in Amazon EC2</li>
<li>Everyone works on the same datasets</li>
<li>Organizers select the features</li>
<li>You contribute a classifier learning algorithm with your own fitness function, operators and search logic</li>
<li>You contribute a classifier learning algorithm which accepts training data in csv format and references a Java properties file which you provide (details below), and outputs a classifier.</li>
<li>You contribute a classifier learning algorithm in executable format (Java, python) or as source code (must be compilable in Linux: C, C++ etc)</li>
<li>You contribute a piece of code which applies your classifier to test data and produces labels.</li>
<li>FCUBE executes your algorithm with the competition training data</li>
<li>FCUBE retrieves the solutions from the cloud nodes, computes the testing predictions, and returns them to you.</li>
<li>FCUBE also filters and fuses the predictions using different methods. Everyone receives their fused results and everyone contributes to a collaborative fused solution among all contributors.</li>
</ul><p>For more detailed information yo can contact us by :

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
